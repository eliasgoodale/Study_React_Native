FLUX

React is more of a library than a framework. It is not a complete solution for app development. Instead it is a view-layer solution with some mechanisms for maintaining internal state and has no opinion on solutions for data flow and management, server communication, routing, or other concerns.

Often react is paired with the application architecture FLUX.

The foundational building block of React is the component

React keeps a respresentation of the DOM in memory (virtual DOM) and makes all alterations there. 




JSX:

    JSX and HTML5 are similiar in that they are both descendants of XML

    Self Closing Tags EXAMPLE
        * HTML5: <img src="my/image.jpg>
        * JSX: <img src="my/image.jpg/> * required closing / *
   
    Class Keyword - class is a keyword in JS so class keyword is changed for JSX
        * HTML5: <class="news-item">
        * JSX: <className="news-item">

    We can use JSON within markups instead of strings
        * HTML5: <div styles="background: green; color: red;">
        * JSX: <div styles={{background 'green', color 'red'}}>
    
    We can control dynamic content in JSX
        * HTML5: <span>Hello World</span>
        * JSX: <span>{'Hello' + 'World'}<span/>
    
    You may add tags based on application components in JSX
        * JSX: <NewsItem>Hello React!<NewsItem>






Concepts:




React Components - Declaritive description of some visual feature on the page. (forms, menus, etc.)
    
    *   Modular components - When creating a news feed component sub components are broken down as follows
        > News feed: made of : News Items
        >> News Items: made of: Image, Title, Description, Byline


Component Properties(Props)
    * Props allow for components to be dynamic

    * Proptypes are how we formally tell other devlopers what properties a component accepts and what value types those properties should be.
